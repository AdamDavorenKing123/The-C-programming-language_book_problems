This repository contains all of my attempts and solutions to the exercises in the book "The C Programming Language - 2nd Edition" Book by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie

Plan Of Action:
Complete min chapters 1-4 to build a good base for robotics.
Complete as many Q's as I can by myself.
Maintain and grow skills whilst moving on to other languages like Python, C++, etc.
